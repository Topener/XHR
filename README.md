# ti.xhr:
ti.xhr is a wrapper around Titanium's HTTPClient. It works perfectly with REST API endpoints and has a built in cache system that you can use for your requests. But it also can be use for any HTTP requests, you can even cache remote images.


> Version 3.0.0 is incompatible with any previous version. Only slight refactor is needed to make the method arguments a single object instead.


## Installation.
Use NPM to install ti.xhr.

Run this command in your `lib` folder (Alloy) or `Resources` folder (classic).
```
npm i ti.xhr
```

Or install it by download the latest release from the `dist` folder and unpackage it in your root directory.

## Usage:
In your alloy.js (or elsewhere), call:

```javascript
//include ti.xhr
var xhr = new(require("ti.xhr"))();
```

All methods share the same structure, though with `PUT`, `POST` and `PATCH` require both the `url` and the `data` properties. `GET` and `DELETE` require just the `url` property, `data` is not supported.
```javascript

// structure for DELETE looks the same as for GET
xhr.GET({
    url: 'http://freegeoip.net/json/',
    onSuccess: onSuccessCallback,
    onError: onErrorCallback,
    extraParams: options
});

xhr.DELETE({});

// structure for PUT and PATCH is the same as for POST
xhr.POST({
    url: 'http://freegeoip.net/json/',
    data: myData,
    onSuccess: onSuccessCallback,
    onError: onErrorCallback,
    extraParams: options
})

xhr.PUT({});
xhr.PATCH({});
```

## Options

In the 5 API call methods you can set options, but doing this every time might be a bit frustrating. Especially if you want authentication for every API call. (or other options). You can set it globally like this

```javascript
xhr.setStaticOptions(options);
```

If you do specify options in an API call, it will not ignore global options. This might be useful if all but 1 API call should be authenticated for example.

### Available Options

* `async` (default `true`) - If an API call should be async or not
* `ttl` (default `false`) - Minutes the API response should be cached (only works with `GET()`)
* `shouldAuthenticate` (default `false`) - Should the call be made with authentication? BASIC Auth & oAuth supported
* `oAuthToken` - oAuth token. Only works if `shouldAuthenticate` is `true`
* `username` - Username for BASIC authentication. Only works if `shouldAuthenticate` is `true` and `oAuthToken` is not set
* `password` - Password for BASIC authentication. See `username`
* `contentType` (default `application/json`)- contentType for API call.
* `parseJSON` (default `false`) - Should provided data for `POST()` and `PUT()` be stringified and response (for all methods) be parsed.
* `returnXML` (default `false`) - Do you expect XML returned, put this to `true`
* `debug` (default `false`) - Do you want `Ti.API.info` to show API calls made
* `requestHeaders` (default `[]`) - Add custom request headers to the request

For some examples please check out the [examples.js](https://github.com/topener/XHR/blob/master/examples.js) file. Or browse around the [ti.xhr.js](https://github.com/topener/XHR/blob/master/ti.xhr.js) file. You can find in there support for GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE

### requestHeaders property
To add extra, custom, requestHeaders to the http request, you can set an array like this:

```javascript
    xhr.setStaticOptions({
        requestHeaders: [
            {
                key: 'myCustomId',
                value: 'myCustomValue'
            }
        ],
        debug: true
    });
```

This will set the requestHeader like you would do previously:
```js
    xhr.setRequestHeader('myCustomId', 'myCustomValue');
```

## Helpers
Apart from the RESTful way of interacting with your API endpoints, this module also includes the following helper methods:

### clear(url)

* **url**: (required) The URL you want removed from the cache manager

Finds the cached document of the given url (if any) and removes it from the cache manager. This method is useful if you are not satisfied with the results you got at the time.

### clean()
Goes through all the cached documents and delete everything that has been expired (if their TTL timestamp is less than the current time)

This method returns the count of deleted documents

### purge()
Goes through all the documents and deletes everything

This method returns the count of deleted documents

## Backwards Compatibility
Previously `get`, `post`, `put` and `destroy` methods were used. They were deprecated in version 2, and removed in version 3.
